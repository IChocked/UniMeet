# UniMeet

**Project for LA Hacks 2021 K-12 Track**

## Inspiration

Most of us had a hard time finding peers with common interests due to the online format, and we wanted to solve the inability to socialize with peers online. We came up with the idea of matching peers based on their interests and availability.

## What it does
UniMeets takes a user's interests and availability throughout the week and finds another student with similar interests and availability.

## What's next for UniMeet
We plan to add integrations with Google Calendar and a more refined interest tag selection.
